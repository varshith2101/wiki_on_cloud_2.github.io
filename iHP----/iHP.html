    <h1 id="hp-title">Integrated Human Practices</h1>

    <div class="info" style="padding-left: 10vw; padding-right: 10vw; margin-top:5vh;">
        <p>Our iGEM project has been shaped by a deep integration of ethical, environmental, and social considerations through our Human Practices (iHP) work. From the outset, our goal has been to address the widespread issue of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR) in a way that minimizes environmental harm and maximizes social benefit. Engaging with stakeholders in the coffee industry, including farmers and agricultural experts, has provided critical insights into the ecological impact of chemical treatments and the challenges farmers face in adopting sustainable alternatives. This feedback has significantly influenced our project’s design, prompting us to focus on developing a biocontrol agent that is both environmentally friendly and economically viable, ensuring that the end-users—farmers—benefit from a solution that aligns with their resources and farming practices.</p>

        <p>Ethical considerations have played a central role in shaping the experiments and approaches we have employed in the lab. Stakeholder input highlighted the importance of ensuring that our biocontrol agent is effective and safe for the surrounding ecosystems and non-target species. We designed our experiments with these factors, prioritizing rigorous testing to ensure that our solution poses no undue environmental risk. Ethical feedback also emphasized the need for transparency and responsible scientific practice, which has led us to adopt more stringent documentation and safety protocols in our lab work. Throughout the competition, we have continuously refined our project based on ongoing stakeholder input, ensuring that every step of our research and development process remains aligned with the values and concerns of the communities we aim to serve.</p>

        <p>This iterative approach to integrating societal and stakeholder feedback has been fundamental to the evolution of our project. As we moved through the iGEM competition, our Human Practices team remained actively engaged with stakeholders, whose insights guided crucial pivots in our project’s direction. These exchanges allowed us to validate the real-world impact of our biocontrol agent and ensure that it meets the ethical, social, and environmental criteria necessary for successful implementation. By incorporating diverse perspectives and addressing societal needs, our project has grown into a comprehensive solution that not only tackles CLR but also has the potential for broad application in sustainable agriculture, empowering communities and protecting ecosystems globally.</p>

                    Learned about the use of Bordeaux mixture and systemic fungicides, which informed the project’s approach to disease management and helped identify gaps for biotechnological interventions.

                    She emphasized the difficulty of early detection for Hemileia vastatrix (HV) due to its close genetic similarity to other fungi, which results in low numbers of detectable proteins, making separation from other fungi challenging.
                    She discussed the potential for HV to develop resistance to iturin, concluding that single gene mutations are unlikely to result in resistance due to iturin’s complex mechanism, granting the product long-term effectiveness.
                    Athina highlighted the co-evolutionary relationship between iturin and rust fungi, clarifying that the presence of HV on plants doesn't necessarily indicate disease and orange spores on the back of the leaf are the best indicator for initiating fungicide application.
                   She pointed out that environmental factors, particularly disease pressure, strongly influence the severity of HV infection.
                   Her insights about iturin’s complex mechanism and gene mutations gave the team the idea to choose B. subtilis and replace the bacteria’s native promoter with a stronger dual promoter.

                    Dr. Fayaz helped the team find conceptual clarity behind the working of our promoter and helped us realise we may not be able to make our dual promoter work with the repressible promoter being closest to the gene. We were also suggested we add a spacer between the two promoters if there was any hinderance caused by the adjacent sequence of the promoter region it being a transcription factor binding site. We encountered errors in our docking to large lengths of our fragment which was realised during the conversation with him and hence only the core region was docked. He has also helped us in generation of 3D structures required for docking and recommended various docking webtools to try and interpret the results of them all. He is presently guiding us to perform molecular docking simulation for the sigma factors and our promoter fragments.

                    Dr. Sabari highlighted the strong constitutive pVEG promoter, which is frequently used in his lab for GFP expression, where green fluorescence can be seen on the plate.
                    Bacillus subtilis is cold-sensitive, thriving between 20-25°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 37°C, and grows well on LB agar, similar to E. coli.
                    He recommended homology flanks between 500-1kb for transformation, as shorter ones (~350bp) yield low success rates, and offered protocols for transformations and media preparation.
                    Dr. Sabari emphasized proper storage in 50% glycerol at -80°C, as Bacillus subtilis is cold-sensitive, and advised managing cell density to prevent sporulation after extended periods.
                    Also assisted in designing the protocol for our 6-hour bacterial growth curve experiment by guiding us in selecting the appropriate dilution factors and providing support in troubleshooting issues encountered during our previous growth curve attempts.

                    Advised testing two constructs, PbacA and P43, focusing on GFP for quantifying promoter strengths. He explained the influence of the strength of the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) on downstream gene expression. This was incorporated in the team’s dry lab efforts toward studying the dual promoter’s efficacy using the two suggested constructs.

                    Discussed the Polarity effect, noting that dual promoter systems may not always produce cumulative effects but could show synergistic expression in certain constructs. This helped the team formulate a coherent DBTL cycle as the team’s dual promoter construct caused a synergistic effort and also made the team look into whether the construct was multiplicative or additive in nature.

                    Highlighted the importance of a wettable product formulation and suggested using CPEc as a cheaper alternative to Gibson Assembly.

    <p>Our iGEM project has been profoundly shaped by integrating ethical, environmental, and social considerations, driven by continuous engagement with stakeholders through our Human Practices (iHP) work. By collaborating closely with farmers, agricultural experts, and industry stakeholders, we’ve ensured that our solution to Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR) addresses real-world challenges while promoting environmental sustainability and economic viability. The feedback has not only shaped the design of our biocontrol agent but also reinforced the importance of safety, transparency, and responsible scientific practice in every aspect of our research.</p>

    <p>This iterative process of incorporating stakeholder input has allowed us to develop a scientifically rigorous and socially responsible project. Our commitment to addressing the concerns of the communities we aim to serve has strengthened our approach, making our biocontrol agent a solution that can empower farmers, protect ecosystems, and contribute to the future of sustainable agriculture. Through these efforts, we have created a project beyond CLR management, setting a precedent for ethical innovation in biotechnology.</p>
