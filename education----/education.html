    <div class="info">
        Our educational outreach initiative aimed to foster learning across all age groups, from young students to working professionals. By tailoring our approach to each group's needs, we introduced concepts like synthetic biology in a fun and accessible way, promoting inclusivity and lifelong learning. Through hands-on workshops, creative activities, and collaboration with professionals, we focused on breaking down educational barriers and inspiring curiosity in science, ensuring that every learner—regardless of age or ability—has the tools to thrive.

           <p style="padding-right: 8vw; padding-left: 3vw;">Primary school education, covering grades 1 through 5, is the basis for a child's intellectual and social growth. We interacted with young pupils at schools like Madhav Kripa in Manipal, Kendriya Vidyalaya in Udupi, and Gopalapuram Brinda Primary School in Chennai. We introduced basic synthetic biology ideas throughout these workshops, ensuring the content was understandable and enjoyable for their age range. <br><br>To accomplish this, we used inventive teaching strategies, including creating engaging, animated presentations and informative drawings on the board to break down complex concepts. One of the main workshops we conducted was pictionary, one of the easiest ways to create a bond with the young ones. The overwhelming majority of teachers' and students' responses were positive. Pupils demonstrated excitement and a sincere desire to learn more about the topic. This response encouraged us to continue refining our educational outreach, ensuring that the foundational knowledge of synthetic biology is imparted in an enjoyable and stimulating manner.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 9.5vw; padding-right: 3vw;">Middle school education, represents a critical transitional phase between primary and high school, focusing on fostering critical thinking, independence, and a deeper understanding of various subjects. We had the opportunity to introduce synthetic biology to students through quizzes and crosswords by connecting it to topics they were already familiar with, such as basic botany & zoology. These quizzes related these concepts to their curriculum, enhancing their comprehension of synthetic biology and stimulating interest in the field as a potential career path.<br><br>Several schools across different cities provided us the platform to engage with students, including New Horizons Scholar’s School, Mumbai; Alpine Public School, Bangalore; Mother's International School, Jharkhand; and many others. The impact of our efforts was evident in the feedback we received through survey forms and the thoughtful questions posed by the students during the sessions. Many expressed a strong interest in pursuing science and biology in the future, underscoring the positive influence of our initiative on their academic and career aspirations.

            <p style="padding-right: 8vw; padding-left: 3vw;">High school education for grades 11 and 12 is a crucial phase, building on foundational knowledge while fostering advanced skills and subject specialization. Recognizing this, we tailored our sessions to dive deeper into biotechnology and synthetic biology, focusing on technical aspects and career opportunities at the request of teachers. Schools like Beyond 8 in Bangalore, Lions High School, and PU College in Coorg provided platforms for these content-rich sessions, helping students connect their academic learning with real-world applications. Students showed strong interest in how these subjects aligned with their studies and future aspirations.<br><br> Positive feedback indicated our sessions inspired further exploration and consideration of these fields in higher education and beyond. Additionally, we introduced iGEM to collegiate students through workshops, highlighting its structure, notable projects from various teams, and how it fosters innovation in synthetic biology, motivating students to engage in hands-on research and interdisciplinary collaboration.

            <h2>EDUCATION FOR ALL</h2>
            <p style="padding-left: 10vw; padding-right: 3.5vw; margin-top: 3vh;">Inclusive education ensures that all students have equal access to learning opportunities and support regardless of abilities or circumstances. Working with organizations like Asare Rehabilitation Centre in Manipal and Jana Seva Orphanage in Bangalore allowed us to engage with individuals with diverse needs and potentials. These experiences reinforced the importance of inclusivity in education, showing us how every learner can thrive with the right resources. We conducted creative activities like coffee painting and pictionaries, encouraging self-expression and fostering a sense of community. These activities were designed to engage participants enjoyably and inclusively, ensuring everyone felt valued. <br><br>Additionally, we developed an audiobook for visually impaired individuals to provide accessible educational materials. This project, scripted and recorded by our team, aimed to break down learning barriers for the visually impaired, giving them equal access to education. Through these efforts, we aimed to create a more equitable learning environment where no one is left behind, ensuring all individuals have the tools to succeed academically and personally.</p>

            <p style="padding-right: 8vw; padding-left: 3.5vw;">Working professionals are essential to society, contributing significantly to various sectors through their expertise and experience. During our presentation to these professionals, we communicated our ideas clearly, inviting them to share their perspectives, which offered practical and industry-oriented viewpoints. Their feedback helped us refine our approach, ensuring that our project addressed real-world challenges and opportunities more effectively.<br><br>Recognizing the integral role that working professionals play in education, especially in guiding the next generation, we aimed to incorporate their suggestions into our work. By doing so, we ensured that our project aligned with theoretical knowledge and catered to practical applications that could benefit society at large. Furthermore, the professional's ideas about handling stakeholders at their workplace gave us a fresh perspective about our prior experience with our stakeholders and the new experiences we were soon going to experience.
