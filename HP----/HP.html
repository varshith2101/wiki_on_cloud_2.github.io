                    Coffee yield prediction is an essential tool for farmers to manage resources and optimize production. However, as Ms. Sathya from Harley Plantations highlighted soil health, pH balance, and climate unpredictability make accurate predictions difficult. Through our interactions with the Coffee Research Substation in Chettalli and feedback from Dr. Ritu Raval we learned that our biocontrol agent could contribute to stabilizing soil health while combating CLR, thus improving yield predictability and maintaining sustainable farming practices. This dual focus—protecting the environment and ensuring quality yields—reflects our direction with CAAPI.<br>
Assessing coffee quality involves key metrics, including bean density, cupping profiles, and visual inspection. Experts like Sunalini Menon from the Coffee Labs India Pvt. Ltd. and Dr. Somanna Kolimada of the Coffee Planters’ Association explained that CLR drastically reduces the quality of coffee by interfering with the plant’s ability to photosynthesize, ultimately damaging the beans. Our biocontrol agent addresses this issue by attacking CLR directly, offering farmers a sustainable alternative to chemical treatments such as Bordeaux mixture, which can degrade soil quality over time.<br>
The major challenges facing Indian coffee agriculture today are not limited to CLR. Shifting climate patterns and over-reliance on chemical fungicides exacerbate the problem. Our conversations with Mr. Mohan from the Coffee Board of India and Dr. Praveen Kumar highlighted the need for an environmentally friendly, long-term solution. The consensus among farmers and experts was that while chemical fungicides are effective in the short term, they adversely affect the ecosystem and are not sustainable. Stakeholders like Nanda Belliappa and Dr. Somanna Kolimada were especially interested in the potential of our biocontrol agent to replace harmful chemicals and provide a safer, more sustainable alternative.<br>

                    Feedback on our product has been overwhelmingly positive. Mr. Mohan encouraged us to focus on improving coffee yields through CLR biocontrol rather than solely targeting weeds, significantly shifting our project’s focus. This was echoed by Sunalini Menon, who appreciated our efforts and connected us with experts like Dr. Jeena from the Coffee Board to refine our product further. Plantation owners and experts, including Ms. Sathya from Harley Plantations, expressed hope that our biocontrol agent could reduce their reliance on chemical treatments while preserving soil health, making it a game-changer for the industry.<br>
One of the most critical aspects of scaling CAAPI will be ensuring its acceptance within the coffee industry. Ms. Sathya advised us to begin field trials at large estates such as those managed by TATA Coffee and the Coffee Board in Balehonnur to prove the efficacy of our solution. She also suggested that sustainability certifications, such as the Rainforest Alliance Certificate, would be essential for widespread adoption. Dr. Ritu Raval recommended integrating our lab findings with field data to create a robust, scalable product for mass deployment in coffee farming.

                    Several key moments from our stakeholder interactions have profoundly influenced the development of CAAPI. During our visit to the Coffee Museum in Chikmagalur, plantation owners highlighted CLR as the most pressing issue, directing us to focus on this area. In Coorg’s Spice Garden, we observed firsthand the damage caused by CLR in Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta plantations.<br>
At the Coffee Research Substation in Chettalli, experts provided valuable information on CLR management through chemical treatments like Bordeaux mixture, helping us understand how our product could serve as a sustainable alternative. Dr. Sommanna Kolimada’s technical expertise in bacterial-fungal interactions gave us essential insights into refining our experimental design. At the same time, stakeholders like Athina Koutouleaus and Sathya HD emphasized the need for safer, more sustainable solutions to chemical treatments.<br>
Looking ahead, we have developed a clear path for implementation. Experts like Dr. Praveen Kumar and Ms. Anusha from Dr. Reddy’s Lab provided guidance on technical aspects, including software tools and modelling for our biocontrol agent. Additionally, Dr. Sabari Sankar from IISER TVM offered advice on Bacillus subtilis homologous recombination, a technique that could enhance our product’s effectiveness. Based on stakeholder feedback, we are moving forward with field trials, seeking certifications, and continuing our outreach efforts to ensure the success of CAAPI.<br>
One of the team’s most exciting experiences was understanding the world beyond coffee as a beverage. The team had the opportunity to meet a renowned coffee painter - Ms. Hima Bindu. Ms. Hima enjoys her coffee creations, often finding comfort and cheer when she looks at her artwork. She even painted the logo for the World Coffee Conference and was willing to let us into her world of coffee art. This experience gave the team an understanding that coffee was more than just a drink and was culturally incorporated into our daily lives. Being a direct stakeholder by using ground coffee as is to paint, she ignited a spark within the team to look at coffee through a different lens.<br>

                    <p>
                        The survey revealed that several participants lacked an understanding of coffee cultivation. While the general public is aware of coffee as a consumer product, their knowledge about how coffee is grown, the challenges faced by farmers and the intricate processes involved in maintaining healthy coffee crops is limited.<br>
This highlights a gap in public education, particularly in connecting consumers to the agricultural practices behind their favorite beverage. This necessitates educational initiatives explaining the journey from seed to cup, discussing disease-related challenges, and implementing innovative solutions.<br>
Our education program in the form of a session with working professionals was focused on the same lines. It fostered a better understanding of the effort required to grow coffee. Thus encouraging support for sustainable farming practices and helping people appreciate the nuances of coffee cultivation. Once participants were informed about CLR, its severity was recognized in the subsequent survey that was taken to highlight the impact of our outreach and educational efforts.<br>

                <p>
                    However, when asked about genetic modification as a potential solution to CLR, the responses were mixed. While many participants were open to using genetically modified plants to increase crop resistance and yield, others expressed concerns about such practices' long-term safety and environmental impact. This points to a need for further education on the role of biotechnology in sustainable agriculture and how it can coexist with eco-friendly farming methods.<br>
Upon this realization, we curated our education and outreach activities to emphasize the usage of biocontrol agents as a safe and sustainable option against fungal infections in agriculture.

                        Our educational outreach has impacted over 1,500 students across four states, including two of India’s largest coffee-producing regions. Building on the ideals of iGEM, we have worked to facilitate high-quality education through hands-on learning experiences related to sustainable agriculture, biotechnology, and environmental science. We have made a concerted effort to engage students from diverse age groups, backgrounds, and abilities, ensuring that our educational activities are inclusive and accessible. This includes tailored talks, interactive sessions, and educational materials designed for primary school students, university professors, and even local farmers, allowing them to understand the science and sustainability behind our project. Our goal is to inspire future generations to think critically about environmental challenges and empower them with the knowledge and skills to address these issues.

                    <p>Our project is designed to support coffee farmers and workers who face significant environmental and economic impacts due to CLR. Current solutions to combat this disease are toxic, and the lack of sustainable alternatives has caused widespread financial losses in the industry, amounting to billions of dollars. For coffee, a plantation crop that takes years to establish, the inability to control this disease threatens long-term employment and economic stability. By developing a biocontrol agent and a coffee yield prediction model, we aim to stabilize production and protect jobs in the coffee industry, ensuring a sustainable and resilient future for farmers.</p>

                    <p>As consumers ourselves (especially as college students who thrive on caffeine), we understand the importance of responsible coffee consumption. Coffee is a staple beverage worldwide, and its production must align with environmentally sustainable practices. Our project emphasizes the use of biocontrol agents to minimize chemical residues and protect the environment. By reducing the reliance on harmful pesticides and ensuring sustainable cultivation practices, we aim to produce coffee that is free from hazardous substances, promoting healthier consumption for all.

                    <p>Current methods for combating coffee leaf rust are either harmful to the environment or ineffective. Our project is focused on developing a biocontrol agent specifically targeted at coffee leaf rust with the aim of transforming this into a viable industrial product. To ensure its success, we are working on the necessary infrastructure and conditions required to scale up production, integrating scientific innovation with industrial applicability. This will allow us to bring a sustainable solution to the market, benefiting not only the coffee industry but also contributing to broader agricultural sustainability.
