<p>Tarini Sai Padmanabhuni, a 3rd-year BTech student at Manipal Institute of Technology, spent her summer immersing herself in Vietnam’s rich coffee culture. As part of our collaboration, she explored the diverse traditions surrounding Vietnamese coffee, from the popular cà phê sữa đá (iced coffee with condensed milk) to the renowned egg coffee. These unique coffee styles are deeply embedded in the country’s daily life, reflecting a blend of history and innovation.
</p>
<p>Throughout her journey, Tarini connected with many local coffee enthusiasts who shared their personal stories, revealing how coffee is much more than a beverage—it's a cultural cornerstone. One of her videos provides an insightful overview of the coffee scene in Vietnam, demonstrating that coffee holds significance in India and across the globe, with each country bringing its own distinctive twist to the tradition.
</p>
<p>Throughout her journey, Tarini tasted these distinctive coffees and met many people passionate about their daily cup of brew. These interactions gave her valuable insights into how deeply coffee is woven into the daily lives of the Vietnamese. Many of the people she encountered were eager to share their experiences with coffee, reflecting how integral it is to their routines and social interactions.
</p>
<p>This collaboration allowed us to strengthen the global impact of our project by highlighting coffee's worldwide reach and cultural influence. It reinforced the importance of expanding our outreach and understanding coffee's role in communities worldwide, enriching our project’s perspective on international coffee culture.
